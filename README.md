# _Magento-2-Restrict-Zip-Codes_
Magento 2 Restrict Zip Codes by Meetanshi restricts users to place the order based on the zip codes.  The E-commerce platform is meant to reach the global platform. However, owing to reasons like government rules, offering products to local customers only, or managing shipping costs, the store owner may want to restrict orders based on the location.  As far as Magento 2 is concerned, there is no such default functionality and hence Meetanshi has developed the Magento 2 Restrict Zip Codes extension.  The extension prompts the user to enter their zip code and check the delivery availability for the same in the zip code CSV. If the delivery is available, the estimated delivery time is displayed. If not, a custom message restricting the user to place the order is shown.  For more info, visit :
